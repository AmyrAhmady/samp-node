# impl.cpp

As with the header, this is the actual implementation of the plugin's
functionality with no AMX specific code or includes.

Including `common.hpp` for access to `logprintf` is useful for debugging but for
production debug logging, it's best to use a dedicated logging library such as
log-core by maddinat0r.
