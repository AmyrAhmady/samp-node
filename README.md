# samp-node
a SA-MP plugin to support nodejs apps and run them on your server

---------
totally not fully usable yet

(Special thanks to [Damo](https://github.com/damopewpew) for his [samp.js project](https://github.com/damopewpew/samp.js). 80% of native caller code is from that project, cause I didn't want to do all the args processing by myself when there's already something useful out there!)

Todo: 
- [ ] Add a callback/public caller
- [ ] Add samp constant values (eg: INVALID_PLAYER_ID, MAX_TEXT_DRAWS, and etc...)
- [x] Add a native caller
- [x] Event manager https://github.com/AmyrAhmady/samp-node/wiki/Events
