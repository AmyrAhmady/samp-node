## Credits
- [Damo](https://github.com/damopewpew) for his [samp.js project](https://github.com/damopewpew/samp.js). 80% of native caller code is from that project, cause I didn't want to do all the args processing by myself when there's already something useful out there!
- [Hual](https://github.com/Hual/) for some v8 tips he gave me
- [Graber](https://github.com/AGraber) for a few suggestions and helpful advices
- [JustMichael (ADRFranklin)](https://github.com/ADRFranklin) for his contributions, including fixes, features, and any others he's going to do in future
- [iAmir (Amyr Aahmady)](https://github.com/AmyrAhmady) that's me.
